# JsonPlotter

Json plotter used to plot serial data as a human-readable graph.

This project has been created as part of my thesis project
for my Uni. It is written in processing language.

The project can be exported as portable (but rather large) 
standalone app for users not familiar with scripting environments. 
Export to .exe is native for processing IDE, so it is more 
advantageous than writing the app in python and using py2exe, 
as it may behave unexpectedly. 

Please note that this is still work-in-progress and I wouldn't 
recommend using it just yet.
